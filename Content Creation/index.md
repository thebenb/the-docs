# The docs.

This page essentially serves as a "Ben wiki" which will contain plenty of useful information about Content Creation.
A lot of the information on this *may* be slightly biased or based on my own experiences and opinions. ***I will make it extremely clear*** when this is the case.

If you are unable to perceive concepts such as opening a sentence with "I think" or "In my opinion", you may struggle a little.

**Work in progress.** All content released here is currently only done so under the premise that I'm testing out the dynamic content system I've coded for my website. Once we're production-ready, I'll remove this warning.

This section currently is a dump from the original docs website I was working on, which is getting replaced by a new, fancier system.
