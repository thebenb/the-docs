# NewTubers

The Premiere Small Content Creator Community.

## Disclaimer

While I have a fancy "ask us for help" role in NewTubers and thus am a part of the community, this page / website is not officially owned, endorsed, or even proofread by NewTubers.


## What is NewTubers?

> NewTubers is the largest community of content creators on the internet. We are a crowd-sourced help community, designed to help you learn how to make better content, how to grow, and how to make money making content. We are not your audience, but we can help you find that audience!

If you're interested in content creation (whether that be streaming, making YouTube videos, TikToks, etc.) it's highly recommended that you join their [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/NewTubers).

## The Subreddit

The NewTubers subreddit is well-suited for Redditors whoo want to talk about YouTubing (and sometimes streaming). Due to the asynchronous nature of Reddit, it can be sometimes difficult to filter out misinformation when there's little live-debate over topics. Either way, you may benefit from it.

I've hung around there for a few years before joining the server, and in my honest opinion, the Discord is much better.

### "I can't post!"

The subreddit has some restrictions to prevent spam, and unfortunately one of those restrictions ends up filtering out new(er) Reddit users who have a low karma count. In my honest opinion, the Discord server provides much more (and real-time!) value, so feel free to ask your questions in an appropriate channel, in here, or maybe keep reading through this site in case your question has already been addressed.
