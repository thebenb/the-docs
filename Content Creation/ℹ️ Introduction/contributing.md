# Contributing

Want to contribute to this site, or just want to see who has?

## Am I accepting contributions?

I'm more than happy to accept contributions to this site. For the moment, I'm mainly using information I've either shared myself, or sourced from certain trusted individuals.

You can safely assume that I have written a majority of these docs myself, unless I specifically state otherwise. Anything seen on this site that isn't written by me has been proofread and vetted by me before going into production.

In short, if you read something here, I either wrote it myself or agree with it.

If you have any suggestions, please let me know!

## What should I contribute?

If you don't have any suggestions in mind, feel free to check out [this page](what-to-contribute) for ideas.

## How do I contribute?

See: [This page.](/docs/projects/the-docs/how-to-contribute)

### The "easy" way

If you'd like to submit a page to be added to this site, or would like to make some changes, you can contact me via Discord or email ([docs@benb.au](mailto:docs@benb.au)) with your suggested changes.

If I approve of what you've submitted, I'll format it nicely and add it to the site.

### GitHub

Well, since I intend on keeping "The Ben Docs" (kind of) open-source, you can contribute by submitting a pull request to the GitHub repository.

Everyone's got their own way of handling this, so I'm going to leave it as an "If you know, you know." kind of thing.

But... if you're technical enough to know GitHub stuff, then you might want to know the following:

- The website's code (that has so gracefully built this page that you're reading now!) is closed-source. I used NextJS if you're interested though!
- Contributions / suggestions to other parts of the site (e.g. the CSS, front page, etc.) are welcome, but will likely be rejected unless I know you, or you make a good case.
- Separately hosted forks are detrimental to the project, and legally questionable due to the project's license.
- Docs are to be typed in Markdown with the appropriate filetype (`.md` or `.mdx`).
- If I feel the need to edit your contribution, I may close the pull request and add the work in a different way. Don't worry, you will still be credited as per the below standards.

## Accreditation

Honestly, you shouldn't be contributing for exposure, or credit, or anything like that. I expect contributors to be like me - mainly doing this out of the goodness of their own hearts.

Nevertheless, if you contribute a whole page, you will be credited at the bottom of said page, and if you contribute a significant amount, I'll place you in the below section.

If you're *super-duper cool* and *special*, I might even add you on this site as an "author". It doesn't really mean much, but you'll get a chance to add some social links and I might let you put up a blog post.

A very exclusive set of people may receive content moderation priviledges, making these docs less reliant on me. This is my long-term goal for this.
