# What to contribute

The following is a non-final, and **non-limiting** list of ideas I have come up with for pages that either need some improvement, or need to be created in general.

These ideas are to be used as inspiration. Feel free to submit your create content based on your own ideas or simply toss some more ideas to the list here.

*   SEO (and why it's a no no)
*   Analytics
    *   Sample size bias
    *   CTR / Watch time / What matters
*   OBS Recording settings
*   Gear suggestions
    *   Microphones
    *   Use your phone!
*   More complete version of [Video Editing Software](/docs/content-creation/tools-resources/video-editing-software) featuring the software listed at the bottom on the page
*   AI tool links and how they can help creators
*   Monetisation explanations
*   Shorts vs longform
