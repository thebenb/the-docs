# The docs.

This page essentially serves as a "Ben wiki" which will contain plenty of useful information about Content Creation.
A lot of the information on this *may* be slightly biased or based on my own experiences and opinions. ***I will make it extremely clear*** when this is the case.

If you are unable to perceive concepts such as opening a sentence with "I think" or "In my opinion", you may struggle a little.

**Work in progress.** All content released here is currently only done so under the premise that I'm testing out the dynamic content system I've coded for my website. Once we're production-ready, I'll remove this warning.

This section currently is a dump from the original docs website I was working on, which is getting replaced by a new, fancier system.

These docs are nowhere near finished! Please allow us (me) time to add to them over time. What is currently present may be useful, but may feel incomplete for some time.

### Why should I trust you?

This is a fair question. I am a random guy on the internet. I'm likely severely under qualified to dare make a wiki/documentation website. Nevertheless:

1. Logic and common sense.

    It doesn't matter who I am half the time. The points I make are often backed up with solid reasoning and logic. You don't have to trust me, you can make your own judgement calls based on the reasoning I provide.
2. I'm a trusted individual.

    In [NewTubers](newtubers), I've got the "Ask us For Help" Role. This indicates that my word is worth something. This will be my one and only "power play" in regard to the role.
3. I have no reason to lie to you.

    You're not "competition" to me in the sense that if I help you out, you'll "take" away from me. Millions of videos are posted every day. What's another drop in the ocean?
    I love content creation. I love talking about it, and I want to share what I know with people. That's it.
