This is the third time I've done a "Hello world" post. One of them is/was public, and the other never really got to see the light of day, as I completely re-wrote this website from the ground up before I ever published the first ever re-write.

Welp, in the spirit of keeping the joke going, here's the latest version of the (copy-pasted with slight adjustments) post... that totally isn't just used as a means of padding out this website while I develop it.

# It's "Hello World", I know...

I'm not exactly proud or embarrassed to say that I sometimes run purely off a little spite. In some class, I was once made to do a "hello world" website task, an absolute classic. Now don't get me wrong - I didn't have a problem with this task, it's as easy as it sounds - type `<p>Hello World!</p>` into an HTML file, and then open it in a browser. For some stupid reason, I wanted to be _different_, so I put my own bit of personality into my task just to make it a little more "fun".

I guess I could say that I'm not like other- I'm kidding, I'm not going to say that.

Honestly, this story doesn't really have a real lesson or moral to it, I just wanted to share it as a silly little way to justify the title of this post. I'm not sure if I'll ever change it, because at this point, "Howdy Universe" is a harmless tradition of mine, and I guess it could be your own too.

I guess the point is - We can all make things our own in some way.

# About...

"About" pages always just feel a little weird. I rarely visit one unless I'm trying to find some information about something/someone, and most other times I just ignore the option to visit one. Now that I'm writing one, I feel like that this page is going to be very important. I'll mention why in a moment.

## This website

I've been wanting to make a website for a while, ~and I've finally gotten around to it!~ and when I made one, I completely abandoned it, only to return ~a year later with a complete re-code.~ well over a year later only to re-code it on an entirely different framework. But hey, this one is endgame! Totally...

Anyway, this website is essentially 2 things:

1.  A portfolio of sorts
    
2.  Housing for my web projects
    
3.  A blog. Whatever that means.
    

### Disclaimer

To me, the "blog" element is just a pretty label to put on a website with opinionated or non "factual" takes. Amongst the things I say are opinions and statements. While I try to keep an open mind, and I'll almost always listen - I'm pretty damn clear when I've got an opinion about something. That being said, **_my opinions are my own._** On this website, I'm not speaking on behalf of a company, or a group of people, or really any other entity (unless specified otherwise). I'm just speaking on behalf of myself.

If I say that something sucks, it's because _I, personally,_ have reasons to believe that something sucks. If I say that something is great, it's because _I, personally,_ have reasons to believe that something is great. I'm just sharing my thoughts.

I am not defaming anyone, nor am I out to attack anyone in particular. Furthermore, I maintain a level of professionalism where I avoid naming names. In the event that someone may personally identify with a vague description (Hypothetically, if I say that I met someone smelly, and you think that I'm talking about you), then that is **_your own perception_** of the matter (and within the bounds of the example, if you're identifying with this "smelly" person, then consider taking a shower).

I state this firmly due to previous experiences I've had. I know what defamation means, and it is not something I have committed, or will commit any time soon. My thoughts have basis, and are simply just **_my thoughts._** Sometimes people will agree with a negative opinion that I have, _but that doesn't mean I'm trying to wage a war._

For my more informational / educational content, my [open-source docs project](/docs) is the way to go.

## Me

Oh, me? You want to know about me? - Okay I'll stop, I don't really know why I wanted to write that, it's not even that funny.

I'm Benjamin Barrett, 21 years old as of writing this.

I'm studying Computer Science, majoring in Software Development. I also work full-time as a Sysadmin.

While I shall probably remain unspecific about _which_ University I'm at, the information is out there on more professional career-facing websites. I choose to remain quiet here for privacy's sake, and so my aforementioned voiced opinions are less targeted-feeling.

### Do you do anything else?

Yes, in fact, I do! (This joke is beginning to grow on me, I will admit.)

When I'm not a slave to assignments, I have a variety of interests and hobbies. You could even argue that my hobby is "learning random things".

There's a good chance you'll see the following topics on this site:

*   Programming Projects that I've worked on (not for my education, but for me)
    
*   Content Creation, including video editing, or just general commentary on stuff I've made or want to make.
    
    *   Educational content on Content Creation as part of the docs.
        
*   Gaming
    
*   Random, "personal" stuff. It is my blog, after all.
    

:::note

Don't worry, I'm not going to broadcast my mental breakdown, I just mean random things that don't fit anywhere else, like if I'm talking about a new hobby I've picked up, or a new interest I've found.

I hope that's enough information. I'd feel like a bit of a narcissist if I said much else, really.
